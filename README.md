# DataScience16WarmupProject
This is the warm-up project for Olin College's Data Science course. In this project, students were tasked with looking at kaggle's [Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/leaderboard?submissionId=2507145) data. In three stages, student's explored the dataset, developed a first pass model for making survival predictions, and then iterated on their models.

This repo contains three ipython notebooks which described each of these steps, as well as the generated data files which were ultimately submitted to kaggle.

## To Run
If you are interesting in running any of the notebooks, do be sure that you have Anaconda installed. You can open any notebook by typing in the command line ipython notebook with the filename. 

## Results
The final model in the iteration two notebook achieved a score of 0.80383, an improvement from a [Dataquest tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/mission/75/improving-your-submission) on this matter (achieves a score of 0.79904), but not surpassing other sources which were referenced in the making of this including a [blog post](http://elenacuoco.altervista.org/blog/archives/1195) and [R tutorial](http://trevorstephens.com/post/72916401642/titanic-getting-started-with-r). At the end of the second iteration notebook I have included a reflection on the project.
