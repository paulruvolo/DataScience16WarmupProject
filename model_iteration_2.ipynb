However, their accuracy with the test data was slightly (1 or 2 predictions) lower than what I got with the gradient boosting alone, so I'm not sure if this would be worth pursuing.  With both the random forest and gradient boosting, I would be interested in looking into a better way of choosing which features to use as predictors.  `SelectKBest` didn't seem to do a great job, and my intuitions often did worse than I expected.  With the way Kaggle is set up, it's impossible to do an exhaustive search using the test data, and as we've seen in this iteration, higher cross validation scores do not necessarily mean better test accuracy.  Is there a good way to search across features to find the best ones to use as predictors?"
